# Webinar-TKL-4-6-2017

Thank you all for attending today! I am going to make some corrections in documentation and focus on both the VIRL and Stand-alone 9K simulator. I believe it's much more relevent than what I had to work with before. I will test the Scripts fully before uploading. I will do my best to provide direction within the code itsef. If you all would be so kind as to give me until Monday to complete all of this it would be greatly appreciated. Last thing I want is to provide you with innacurate info that causes you to believe that YOU are doing something wrong.

I will provide the VIRL Topologies that I will use for testing to further insure success out of the gate.

Thank you,
Rick Kollins
